# _projectname_

_description_

Describe what this project does. Keep this language human and friendly, so avoid internal references, acronyms and if you 
have dependencies, provide a direct link to these.

When describing features of your project, remember to explain why these are a benefit and advantage to the user:

```
This project allows you to scale X (feature) in a fast and predictable way (benefit) - meaning you will use fewer resources and can be confident in your X environment (Advantage).
```

Think about your project as a product, consider who your audience is, and how your decisions affect the number of potential users, below is a handy checklist of things to consider before open sourcing any code. 

- **Avoid internal dependencies** Obviously projects that require Zalando specific infrastructure, configuration or process have very limited use to anyone outside Zalando. 
- **Avoid narrow usecases** Does this solve a Zalando-only problem or does it have broarder application - is there things you could change to make it a more general product
- **Have a Product vision** Do you know where you want to take this product? - then be open about it so future contributors are aware. Being opinionated is great and it helps set expectations and the direction for the project
- **Take ownership** Are you are benevolent dictator or open to anything? - consider how you will interact with future contrbutors who expect you to be an active maintainer
- **Safe defaults** How do people get up and running - are there alot of ceremony involved or can you provide a simple out of the box experience so it is easy for users to evaluate your project
